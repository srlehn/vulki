## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.15] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed (MSL)

- **MSL: workgroup vars at function-body scope** (PR #77, @georgebuilds) —
  workgroup (`threadgroup`) variables are now declared inside the kernel function
  body (`threadgroup T name;`) instead of as entry-point parameters
  (`threadgroup T& name`). The parameter form requires the host to call
  `setThreadgroupMemoryLength:atIndex:` before dispatch (Rust wgpu-hal does this);
  our Pure Go Metal HAL does not, causing workgroup memory to silently no-op.
  Function-scope declarations are legal MSL, statically sized by the compiler,
  and need no host-side setup. Verified on Apple M3 Max with Metal 3.1 runtime.
  Intentional divergence from Rust naga, recorded in reference allow-list.
- **MSL: per-entry-point workgroup zero-init filtering** — `writeWorkgroupZeroInit`
  now filters by entry-point usage (matching Rust naga `fun_info[handle].is_empty()`),
  so only workgroup vars actually used by the entry point are declared and zeroed.
  Fixes latent bug where unused vars were incorrectly zero-initialized.

### Changed

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — added snapshot test infrastructure documentation
  (golden file naming convention, reference allow-list, adding new test shaders),
  updated project structure (hlsl, dxil, snapshot, cmd/spvdis, cmd/dxilval),
  added testing commands (TestRustReference, UPDATE_GOLDEN, SPIR-V validation).

## [0.17.14] - 2026-06-08

### Added (GLSL)

- **GLSL version-aware binding support (BUG-GLES-005)** — GLSL backend now
  provides full infrastructure for runtime binding fallback on GL < 4.2 drivers
  (e.g., WSL2 Mesa d3d12 with GL 4.1 / GLSL 410). Follows Rust wgpu-hal
  `device.rs:438-461` pattern.
  - `SupportsExplicitLocations()` method on `Version` — gates `layout(binding=N)`
    emission on GLSL >= 420 (desktop) or >= 310 (ES). Matches Rust naga
    `mod.rs:213`.
  - `UniformInfo` struct — reflection data for uniform/storage blocks (block name,
    binding, storage flag). Populated during GLSL code generation.
  - `TranslationInfo.Uniforms` field — carries uniform block reflection to the
    HAL for post-link `glGetUniformBlockIndex`/`glUniformBlockBinding` assignment.
  - `VersionES300` constant — safe minimum for OpenGL ES contexts.
  - Writer collects `uniformInfos` during `writeUniformBlock`, `writeUniformVariable`,
    and `writeStorageVariable` for the runtime binding fallback path.

## [0.17.13] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed (DXIL)

- **PHI node ordering** — mem2reg Phase B phi instructions now grouped at
  top of basic blocks before non-phi instructions. Fixes `path_count.wgsl`
  (Vello tilecompute) IDxcValidator "PHI nodes not grouped at top of basic
  block" error. Root cause: merged StmtEmit runs emitted low-handle regular
  expressions before high-handle phi expressions.

### Added

- Test coverage waves 3-4: hlsl 70.6%, wgsl/lower 65.3%, msl 64.2%,
  spirv 76.5%, dxil/emit 37.4%. Overall ~60%.

## [0.17.12] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- **ARCH-001: Internal packages refactoring** — all backends restructured
  following DXIL pattern. Implementation moved to `internal/codegen/`,
  public API uses real types (not aliases).
  - `glsl/internal/codegen/` — 9 files, thin public wrapper
  - `msl/internal/codegen/` — 10 files, thin public wrapper
  - `hlsl/internal/codegen/` — 15 files, shared namer in `internal/backend/`
  - `spirv/internal/codegen/` — 5 files, thin public wrapper
  - `wgsl/internal/parser/` + `wgsl/internal/lower/` — parser/lowerer split
  - `internal/registry/` — TypeRegistry extracted from ir/
  - `internal/textutil/` — shared IndentWriter (DRY across glsl/hlsl/msl)
  - Public API surface reduced from 398 to ~120 symbols

### Fixed

- **13 panics converted to error returns** across all backends.
  GLSL/HLSL `exitLoop`/`exitSwitch` stack corruption, SPIR-V
  `emitScalarType`/`addressSpaceToStorageClass`/`findTypeHandleByID`
  and 6 more. ~200 caller sites updated.

- **Unsupported stage validation** — GLSL and MSL now reject mesh/task
  shader stages with clear error messages instead of generating invalid code.

### Added

- **Test coverage: 12/18 packages ≥80%**. Enterprise-quality tests with
  hand-crafted IR modules, output verification, and regression protection.
  - 100%: internal/textutil, dxil/internal/module
  - 96.6%: internal/backend
  - 92.9%: dxil/passes/mem2reg
  - 88.6%: dxil/passes/dce
  - 83.8%: wgsl/parser, dxil/bitcode
  - 83.0%: dxil/viewid, dxil/passes/sroa
  - 81.1%: ir
  - 80.6%: glsl/codegen, 80.8%: dxil/container

## [0.17.11] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed (DXIL)

- **Array-of-vector flattening** ([BUG-DXIL-041](docs/dev/kanban/1-next/BUG-DXIL-041-fine-wgsl-invalid-record.md)).
  `array<vec4<f32>, N>` locals caused "Invalid record" from IDxcValidator.
  Three coordinated bugs: (1) GEP index not scaled by vector width,
  (2) single-scalar load instead of multi-scalar vector load,
  (3) garbage component IDs from missing `pendingComponents`. Fixed via
  `tryLoadVectorFromFlatArray()` and `scaleIndexForVecArray()`.
  Reported by wgpu agent via `fine.wgsl` (tilecompute blend stack).

### Metrics

- gg production: 58/59 → **61/61 (0 failures)** 🏆
- DXC golden diff=0: 105 (unchanged)
- Line parity: 55.1% (unchanged)
- IDxcValidator: 161/170 (unchanged)

## [0.17.10] - 2026-04-30

### Added (DXIL)

- **Workgroup struct decomposition** — struct-typed groupshared variables
  decomposed into per-member globals with MSVC-mangled suffix names.
- **ViewID ExprAlias/ExprPhi** — precise post-mem2reg dataflow tracking
  instead of conservative all-inputs→all-outputs fallback.
- **Instruction scheduling infrastructure** — eval-right-first for resource
  reads, `exprLeadsToResourceRead()`, `leafEmitPriority()`.
- **StmtEmit range merging** — consecutive emit ranges merged for
  cross-range reassociation.
- **Constant folding** — int-to-float casts (`sitofp`/`uitofp`), bitcast
  float→i32 for raw buffer stores, binary op folding infrastructure.
- **Alignment encoding fix** — `log2(bytes)+1` for store/load/alloca/globalvar.
- **Mul-to-shl in CBV/UAV** — byte-offset stride via `addMulOrShlInstr()`.
- **TBAA normalizer** — strip LLVM optimization hint metadata.

### Metrics

- DXC golden diff=0: 104 → **105** (+1)
- Line parity: 54.5% → **55.1%** (+0.6pp)

## [0.17.9] - 2026-04-30

### Added (DXIL)

- **Per-member loadInput DCE** — backwards reachability analysis eliminates
  `dx.op.loadInput` calls for unused struct input members after inlining.
- **Zero-store local promotion** — unassigned struct members resolve to zero
  constants, eliminating alloca/load chains.
- **Same-type integer cast elimination** — `bitcast i32↔i32` is no-op.
- **Sub→add canonicalization** — `sub X, C` → `add X, -C` for positive constants.
- **Mul→shl strength reduction** — `mul X, 2^N` → `shl X, N`.
- **QuantizeF16 via legacy ops** — `dx.op.legacyF32ToF16`/`F16ToF32` instead
  of `fptrunc`/`fpext`. Eliminates NativeLowPrecision flag cascade (13 shaders).
- **Int64 flag from emitted bitcode** — scans LLVM module, not IR type arena.
- **AtomicInt64OnHeapResource flag** — 64-bit atomics on non-workgroup resources.
- **MSVC groupshared name decoration** — `\01?name@@3typeA` format for workgroup vars.
- **createHandle legacy path** — always use opcode 57, removed unused
  createHandleFromBinding path.

### Fixed (DXIL)

- **Input sigId** — uses element index, not register row. Fixes packed inputs.
- **ViewID StartCol** — packed linear indexing includes column offset.
- **Cross-argument struct input ordering** — reverse signature order globally.

### Metrics

- DXC golden diff=0: 94 → **104** (+10)
- Line parity: 48.1% → **54.5%** (+6.4pp)

## [0.17.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Function call argument type validation** ([#66](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/issues/66)).
  WGSL lowerer now validates argument count and types against function
  parameters. Passing `vec2<u32>` where `u32` is expected now produces a
  clear compile error instead of silently generating invalid shader code
  that crashes at pipeline creation. Reported by @maxsupermanhd.

- **Mandatory semicolons** — 16 places in the parser changed from optional
  to required semicolons per WGSL grammar. `const X: u32 = 42` without `;`
  now errors. For-loop init/update handled via `inForHeader` context flag.

- **`@must_use` enforcement** — functions with `@must_use` attribute now
  reject calls where the result is discarded as a statement.

- **`@compute` requires `@workgroup_size`** — compute entry points without
  `@workgroup_size` attribute now error at compile time.

- **`const_assert` evaluation** — `const_assert false;` now produces a
  compile error. Supports bool literals, negation, logical ops, integer
  comparisons, and named constants. Complex expressions gracefully skipped.

- **`@binding`/`@group` pairing** — resource variables with `@binding`
  but no `@group` (or vice versa) now error.

- **Zero-sized arrays rejected** — `array<T, 0>` now produces a compile
  error per WGSL spec (array size must be positive).

- **Invalid swizzle components** — GLSL-only `s/t/p/q` swizzle names
  rejected. Mixed namespaces (`v.xg`, `v.rb`) rejected. Only `x/y/z/w`
  and `r/g/b/a` accepted, each set must be used consistently.

### Validation parity

All 8 fixes verified against Rust naga — identical rejection behavior.

## [0.17.6] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed (DXIL)

- **Single-store local promotion** — eliminates alloca/store/load chains
  for vertex/fragment output staging, matching DXC's direct `storeOutput`.
- **Sampler heap after input loads** — DXC emit ordering for fragment shaders.
- **HLSL namer suffix** — trailing `_` on resource names ending with
  digits or matching HLSL keywords.
- **Input used mask sorted order** — correct extended properties metadata
  for fragment shaders with multiple struct inputs.
- **Fragment input signature ordering** — LOC semantics before SV_Position.
- **Raw buffer i32 overload** — float loads via i32 + bitcast, matching
  DXC ByteAddressBuffer convention.
- **Strength reduction** — `urem x, 2^N` → `and x, (2^N-1)` at emit time.

### Metrics

- DXC golden diff=0: 82 → **94** (+12)
- Line parity: 46.5% → **48.1%**

## [0.17.5] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`ir.TypeSize()` — shared type size calculation** matching Rust naga
  `TypeInner::try_size(gctx)`. Used by wgpu core for late buffer binding
  size validation (VAL-006). 23 unit tests.

- **`ir.StorageFormat.IsUnorm()` / `IsSnorm()`** — predicate methods for
  storage texture format classification, used by DXIL backend for correct
  component type metadata.

### Fixed (DXIL)

- **UNorm/SNorm component types** — `rgba8unorm` → `UNormF32` (14) in metadata.
- **CBV metadata size** — actual struct size, not vec4-rounded.
- **Named metadata ordering** — `!dx.resources` before `!dx.viewIdState`.
- **dx.op attribute classification** — correct `nounwind readonly` attributes.

### Changed

- **DXC golden normalizer** — function declarations and attribute definitions
  sorted alphabetically, eliminating false-positive ordering diffs.

### Metrics

- DXC golden diff=0: 72 → **82** (+10)
- Line parity: 45.7% → **46.5%**

### Notes

- **DXIL validation gate terminology.** Prior releases reported "N/N DXC
  validation" pass counts. The underlying command is `dxc.exe -dumpbin`,
  which is a parser-printer (structural parse + human-readable dump), not
  a full DXIL validator. It catches malformed bitcode (e.g. the "Invalid
  record" class of bugs fixed in BUG-DXIL-004) but does NOT cross-check
  ABI-level metadata against D3D12 runtime expectations (e.g. PSV0
  `ShaderStage` byte against the pipeline slot). **Genuine validation via
  `IDxcValidator::Validate()` — including a three-layer defensive wrapper
  that prevents `dxil.dll` AV on any input — landed in 0.17.4 (see
  `cmd/dxilval`, `internal/dxcvalidator`, and BUG-DXIL-VALIDATOR-REAL
  entries below).** CHANGELOG/README/ROADMAP wording in past entries has
  been left as-is for historical accuracy; new entries distinguish
  "DXC parse" from "IDxcValidator real validation".

## [0.17.4] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **`cmd/dxilval` — Pure Go DXIL validation CLI backed by IDxcValidator**
  (FEAT-DXIL-010 + BUG-DXIL-VALIDATOR-REAL, v0.17.4). First-ever Pure Go
  integration with Microsoft's `IDxcValidator` (`dxil.dll`), zero CGO.
  Three modes: `dxilval shader.dxil` validates a single container,
  `dxilval --wgsl shader.wgsl` compiles through naga and validates each
  entry point, `dxilval --corpus dir/` walks a directory and reports a
  typed-error summary. Internal `internal/dxcvalidator` package wraps
  `IDxcValidator` via `syscall` + a custom `IDxcBlob` implemented through
  `syscall.NewCallback`, spawns a fresh OS thread via `kernel32!CreateThread`
  (mandatory — `dxil.dll`'s thread-local allocator is set up in
  `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`, which Windows only fires for threads created AFTER
  `LoadLibrary`), and falls back to Windows 10 SDK paths when `dxil.dll`
  is not on `PATH`. The empirical "first-ever `VALID (S_OK)`" check on
  the golden `tmp/min1_final.dxil` fixture is now a permanent unit test
  (`TestSmokeValidateGoldenFixture`) instead of a one-off PoC.

- **`internal/dxcvalidator` — three-layer defensive validation stack**
  (BUG-DXIL-VALIDATOR-REAL, v0.17.4). Any blob handed to `dxil.dll`
  passes through a staged defence that prevents the validator-AV classes
  documented in Phase 0 research:

  - **Layer 0 — emitter-side assertion.** `dxil/internal/emit/emitter.go`
    now refuses to emit a container when the entry function is unset.
    Without this guard, the BUG-DXIL-012 regression class would write
    `!dx.entryPoints[0][0] = null`, which causes `IDxcValidator` to AV
    at `dxil.dll+0xe9da` (NULL+0x18) in its entry-point walker. Any
    future regression becomes an attributable Go error instead of a
    silent process crash.
  - **Layer 1 — `PreCheckContainer` structural check**
    (FEAT-VALIDATOR-PRECHECK-001). `internal/dxcvalidator/precheck.go`
    walks the DXBC container at fixed offsets and rejects truncated
    blobs, bad magic, bad part counts, malformed part headers, missing
    `DXIL` / `ILDB` / `PSV0` / `ISG1` / `OSG1` parts, invalid PSV0
    stage bytes, and empty entry-function-name strings. Ten typed
    sentinel errors (`errors.Is`-switchable), every branch exercised by
    unit tests, runs before the `HeapAlloc` copy so rejection costs
    nothing.
  - **Layer 2 — `bitcheck.Check` bitcode metadata walker**
    (FEAT-VALIDATOR-BITCHECK-001). `internal/dxcvalidator/bitcheck/` is
    a minimal Pure Go LLVM 3.7 bitstream reader mirroring
    `dxil/internal/bitcode/writer.go` one-to-one. It walks just far
    enough to find the `!dx.entryPoints` named metadata and verify each
    entry-point tuple has a non-null function reference in operand 0.
    Skips non-metadata blocks via block-length fast-forward. Scoped
    specifically to the BUG-DXIL-012 AV class — not a general-purpose
    LLVM bitcode parser. ~2500 LOC including tests, five typed
    sentinel errors, 72.3% line coverage, DXC abbreviation-decoding
    implemented and exercised via hand-assembled fixtures. A minimal
    real DXC integration fixture is deferred to
    FEAT-VALIDATOR-BITCHECK-002.

  The wrapper is also defensive against sporadic `dxil.dll` misbehaviour
  observed during corpus walking — the validator occasionally returns
  `S_OK` with a `NULL IDxcOperationResult` on some inputs
  (`debug-symbol-large-source.wgsl`), which the wrapper now catches
  and surfaces as a clean typed error instead of dereferencing NULL
  through the COM vtable.

- **DXIL: PSV0 signature element generalization for all binding kinds**
  (BUG-DXIL-019 follow-up, v0.17.4). `buildGraphicsPSVSigs` /
  `makePSVSignatureElement` now cover every graphics-stage I/O binding:
  `LocationBinding` (inputs and non-fragment outputs → arbitrary
  `TEXCOORD` with real location-based index; fragment color outputs →
  `SV_Target` with location as semantic index) plus the full system-
  value set (`BuiltinFrontFacing`, `BuiltinSampleIndex`,
  `BuiltinSampleMask`, `BuiltinClipDistance`, `BuiltinPrimitiveIndex`,
  `BuiltinViewIndex`). Interpolation mode mapping covers all DXIL
  `InterpolationMode` enum values (Constant / Linear / LinearNoperspective
  / Centroid / Sample variants). Per-side (input/output) start-row
  tracking replaces the previous always-zero `StartRow`. Refactor into
  `psvSemanticForBinding` / `psvSemanticForBuiltin` /
  `psvSemanticForLocation` / `psvInterpolationMode` / `psvComponentType`
  helpers for readability.

- **DXIL: `Options.BindingMap`** — public API for remapping WGSL `@group`/`@binding`
  to DXIL `(space, register)`, mirroring `hlsl.Options.BindingMap`. Required for wgpu
  root signatures, which use monotonic per-class counters
  (`SRV=t0,t1,…` / `UAV=u0,u1,…` / `CBV=b0,b1,…`). Without a map, behavior is
  unchanged (raw WGSL numbers used as absolute DXIL registers — backward compatible).
  New public types: `dxil.BindingLocation`, `dxil.BindTarget`, `dxil.BindingMap`.

### Fixed

- **DXIL: read-only storage buffers classified as SRV** — `var<storage, read>` now
  lowers to SRV (t-register, `ByteAddressBuffer`), while `var<storage, read_write>`
  stays UAV (u-register, `RWByteAddressBuffer`), matching the HLSL backend. Previously
  all `SpaceStorage` globals became UAV, causing register collisions in pipelines
  that mix read-only and read-write storage buffers (e.g. particle sim `pin`/`pout`).
  Also fixes latent bug in `resourceKind` where SRV storage buffers fell through to
  `Texture2D` metadata kind.

- **DXIL: SRV storage compute path — binding arrays and struct vector loads**
  (BUG-DXIL-004). Two fixes needed after the SRV classification change to unblock
  real compute workloads:
  - `resolveBindingArrayUAVChainFromGV` was still gated on `class == UAV`, so
    `binding_array<T>` over `var<storage, read>` fell through to a generic scalar
    load path (`binding-buffer-arrays` regressed 163/163 → 162/163). Relaxed to
    `isStorageBufferClass`, matching the other nine `resolveUAV*` helpers.
  - Pre-existing "Invalid record" in `@compute` + vector-field-of-local-struct
    loads, exposed by particles sim: loading `p.vel` where `p` is a local
    `Particle{pos: vec2, vel: vec2}` fell through to generic `emitLoad`, which
    emitted a single scalar `load float` and never set `pendingComponents`.
    Downstream `emitBinaryVectorized`/`getComponentID` grabbed the adjacent
    `cbufferLoadLegacy` struct-typed result as an f32 operand, corrupting the
    bitcode. Fixed by decomposing vector struct-field loads into N per-component
    GEP + scalar load with proper `pendingComponents` tracking.
  - Regression corpus: `compute-storage-read-rw.wgsl` (canonical SRV storage
    compute) and `compute-storage-struct-read-rw.wgsl` (minimal particles
    reproducer). `TestDxilValSummary`: **165/165 (100%)**, up from 163/163.

- **DXIL: DCE pass (dead code elimination)** — mark-and-sweep pass removes dead
  locals, dead control flow, dead pure function calls, and dead resources from
  the IR before DXIL emission. Matches the `DxilLinker.cpp` optimization pipeline
  used by DXC.

- **DXIL: SROA pass (scalar replacement of aggregates)** — struct-typed local
  variables are decomposed into per-member locals, enabling mem2reg promotion
  of individual fields. Init-only locals emit their initializer directly and
  skip alloca entirely.

- **DXIL: mem2reg Phase B** — if/switch phi insertion with SSA construction for
  promoted locals. Extends the existing Phase A (straight-line promotion) with
  control-flow-aware phi placement.

- **DXIL: inline pass improvements** — alias aggregate/opaque args (struct,
  texture, sampler) instead of copying; two-tier inline policy (pure simple
  helpers inlined automatically); early-return wrapping via loop+break pattern
  for helpers with multiple returns; arg-spill StmtEmit coverage for mem2reg
  promotion of spilled arguments.

- **DXIL: PrefixStable register packing** — register allocation now matches the
  DXC algorithm: sort by class priority (UAV > SRV > CBV > Sampler), then by
  declaration order within each class, producing identical ISG1/OSG1/PSG1 row
  assignments.

- **DXIL: createHandle class priority ordering** — handle creation order now
  follows DXC convention (UAV > SRV > CBV > Sampler), fixing validation
  mismatches in shaders with mixed resource types.

- **DXIL: barrier mode flags + noduplicate** — barrier intrinsics now emit
  proper DXIL mode flags and carry the `noduplicate` function attribute,
  matching DXC output exactly.

- **DXIL: fast-math flags + operand canonicalization** — arithmetic instructions
  carry fast-math flags matching DXC defaults; commutative binary ops follow
  LLVM InstCombine canonicalization (constants to RHS); Reassociate pass for
  commutative chains.

- **DXIL: loadInput reverse ISG1 row order** — input loads now emit in reverse
  ISG1 row order matching DXC, with component-level DCE eliminating unused
  loads.

- **DXIL: raw buffer i32 overload + bitcast** — float stores to raw buffers use
  the `i32` `bufferStore` overload with bitcast, matching DXC behavior instead
  of emitting a non-existent float overload.

- **DXIL: post-DCE shader model version auto-upgrade** — after dead code
  elimination, the emitter re-scans used intrinsics and upgrades the SM version
  if remaining code requires a higher minimum (e.g. SM 6.0 → 6.2 for wave ops).

- **DXIL: IR-based input signature Used mask** — ISG1 Used column now computed
  from IR reachability analysis rather than always marking all inputs as used.

- **DXIL: CBV typed struct members** — uniform buffer types now emit LLVM struct
  members with proper types (`[4 x <4 x float>]` for mat4x4) instead of raw
  byte arrays, matching DXC's `hostlayout.struct` convention.

- **DXIL: HLSL-style type naming** — DXIL metadata and type names now use
  HLSL-compatible naming (`class.Texture2D`, `hostlayout.struct.Uniforms`),
  matching DXC for golden diff parity.

- **DXIL: sampler heap SRV ordering + configurable bindings** — sampler heap
  entries follow SRV class ordering; `Options` now supports configurable
  sampler bindings for custom root signature layouts.

- **DXIL: per-component ViewID taint propagation** — output signature ViewID
  dependencies are tracked per-component through the dataflow graph, matching
  DXC's PSV0 ViewID taint analysis.

- **DXIL: dead resource elimination** — unreachable global resources (detected
  via reachable globals analysis after inlining) are excluded from handle
  creation and metadata tables.

- **DXIL: input signature extended-properties null mask** — ISG1 extended
  properties table uses null entries for inputs that carry no extra metadata,
  matching DXC's sparse encoding.

- **DXIL: TestDxilDxcGolden** — new SPIR-V-style golden parity test comparing
  naga DXIL output against DXC reference across 182 shaders. Reports line-level
  parity percentage and exact-match (diff=0) counts.

- **DXIL: TestDxilValGGProduction** — regression guard validating all 57 gg
  production entry points through IDxcValidator on every test run.

### Metrics (DXIL hardening batch)

- **IDxcValidator:** 152/170 → 161/170 (94.7%, +9 shaders)
- **DXC golden diff=0:** 24 → 72 (+48 shaders exact match)
- **DXC golden line parity:** 37.0% → 45.7% (+8.7pp)
- **gg production:** 50/57 → 57/57 (100%, all entry points VALID)
- **Visual:** black screen → circles + text rendering on D3D12 DXIL pipeline
- **Text backends:** 100% unchanged (MSL/HLSL/GLSL/SPIR-V untouched)

## [0.17.3] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **DXIL: CBV (Constant Buffer) loads** — `dx.op.cbufferLoadLegacy` for `var<uniform>`.
  Register index calculation (byteOffset/16), component extraction via `extractvalue`.
  Supports f32/i32/f64/i64/f16 overloads, struct member access at arbitrary offsets.

- **DXIL: Compute shader support (Phase 2)** — `@compute` entry points now compile to DXIL:
  - Thread ID builtins: `dx.op.threadId`, `dx.op.groupId`, `dx.op.threadIdInGroup`,
    `dx.op.flattenedThreadIdInGroup`
  - `numthreads` metadata from `@workgroup_size(X,Y,Z)`
  - UAV storage buffers: `dx.op.bufferLoad`/`dx.op.bufferStore` for `var<storage, read_write>`
  - Atomic operations: `dx.op.atomicBinOp` (add, subtract, and, or, xor, min, max, exchange),
    `dx.op.atomicCompareExchange`, atomic load/store
  - Barriers: `dx.op.barrier` with storage/workgroup/subgroup flag mapping
  - Reference: Mesa `nir_to_dxil.c`

### Fixed

- **DXIL: bitcode binary operation opcodes** — `BinOpKind` constants used LLVM IR enum
  numbering (FAdd=1) instead of bitcode unified opcodes (Add/FAdd=0). DXC decoded our
  FAdd as FSub. Fixed to match Mesa `dxil_module.h` encoding.

- **DXIL: finalize() operand remapping** — `finalize()` remapped ALL instruction operands
  as value IDs, corrupting type IDs, opcodes, alignment values, and basic block indices.
  Added `valueOperandIndices()` that precisely identifies which operands are values per
  instruction type.

- **DXIL: alloca alignment encoding** — Was `log2(bytes)`, should be `log2(bytes)+1` per
  LLVM 3.7 / Mesa `dxil_emit_alloca()`.

- **DXIL: vector local variable scalarization** — Single alloca for `vec4<f32>` replaced
  with per-component allocas. Store/Load now operate on correct components.

- **DXIL: GEP struct access** — Added `getelementptr` (FUNC_CODE_INST_GEP=43) for struct
  member access from local variable pointers. Nested struct access with flat offset
  computation. Struct store decomposed into per-scalar-field GEP + store.

- **DXIL: retail hash wired up** — `ComputeRetailHash()` (INF-0004 modified MD5) was
  implemented but never called. Now used when `UseBypassHash=false`.

- **DXIL: push constants as CBV** — `SpacePushConstant` and `SpaceImmediate` globals
  classified as CBV resources with synthetic bindings.

- **DXIL: resource metadata rewrite** — Per-class metadata matching Mesa exactly. CBV
  fields[6] = buffer size (was resource kind), SRV/UAV 9-11 fields with element type tags,
  fields[1] = undef pointer (was null). Fixes 23 DXC validator crashes.

- **DXIL: struct return decomposition** — Multi-output shaders (struct returns with multiple
  @location fields) now decompose into per-field GEP + scalar load + storeOutput.

- **DXIL: binary op vector scalarization** — Vector binary operations decomposed into
  per-component scalar ops with scalar-vector broadcast.

- **DXIL: global variable allocas** — Non-resource globals (workgroup, private) get proper
  alloca pointers instead of placeholder values.

- **DXIL: array/matrix CBV loads, dynamic GEP, UAV constant-index fix** — Matrix
  CBV loads (one cbufferLoadLegacy per column), array local variable allocas,
  dynamic Access with GEP, UAV constant-index access fix. 3 more shaders pass DXC.

- **DXIL: SRV/UAV direct loads, dynamic CBV index, array output decomposition** —
  SRV/UAV loads routed to bufferLoad (not LLVM load), dynamic CBV index with stride
  arithmetic, ZeroValue/Compose dynamic array access, array-typed builtin outputs.

- **DXIL: typed undef for bufferStore, deep UAV chains, entry-block allocas** —
  Float bufferStore uses typed undef (f32, was i32). Deep UAV pointer chains
  (struct-wrapped arrays, nested Access). All allocas in entry block (was lazy).

- **DXIL: mesh shader intrinsics (SM 6.5)** — SetMeshOutputCounts (168),
  StoreVertexOutput (171), StorePrimitiveOutput (172), EmitIndices (169).
  All 4 mesh shaders pass DXC (9 entry points). PSG1 primitive signatures.

- **DXIL: struct-typed entry point arguments** — Fragment/vertex shaders with struct
  inputs (e.g., `vertex: VertexOutput`) now correctly load per-member with row tracking.
  Fixes 14 additional shaders.

- **DXIL: helper function emission with per-function value ID isolation** — Each helper
  function gets independent value ID space. `collectCalledFunctions()` pre-scans entry point.

- **DXIL: switch statements** — Cascading `icmp eq` + conditional branches with merge block.

- **DXIL: 17 pack/unpack math functions** — pack4x8snorm/unorm, unpack4x8snorm/unorm,
  pack2x16float/snorm/unorm, unpack variants, pack4xI8/U8/clamp, unpack4xI8/U8.

- **DXIL: matrix operations** — mat*vec, vec*mat, mat*mat, mat+/-mat, mat*scalar, transpose.
  All scalarized to component-wise DXIL instructions (dot products for multiply).

- **DXIL: workgroup atomics** — LLVM `atomicrmw`/`cmpxchg` for workgroup variables
  (add, sub, and, or, xor, min, max, xchg, compare-exchange).

- **DXIL: vector select scalarization, math broadcast, ExprArrayLength, helper vector returns,
  struct member component stores, atomic compare-exchange result struct, abstract literals,
  matrix alloca, refract/modf/frexp/quantizeF16** — systematic fixes across emitter.

- **DXIL: atomic type width support (i32/i64/f32)** — workgroup atomics now use correct
  type width instead of hardcoded i32. Fixes f32/i64 atomic shaders.

- **DXIL: ExprOverride + ProcessOverrides** — pipeline override constants now compile.
  DXIL test harness processes overrides (same as SPIR-V/HLSL).

- **DXIL: matrix column extraction, f16 constant encoding** — AccessIndex on matrix
  returns full column vector (was single scalar). F16 constants use IEEE 754 half-precision.

- **DXIL: typed zero constants, CBV/UAV resource pass-through, struct field loads** —
  f16/i64 zero constants use correct types. CBV resource AccessIndex pass-through.
  UAV struct field byte offset + scalar type resolution. Multi-register struct loads.

- **DXIL: FRem lowering** — LLVM FRem lowered to `a - b * floor(a/b)` (DXC rejects FRem).

- **DXIL: texture intrinsics** — `dx.op.getDimensions` (72) for textureDimensions/numLevels/numSamples/numLayers,
  `dx.op.textureLoad` (66) for imageLoad, `dx.op.textureStore` (67) for imageStore.

- **DXIL: complex UAV access chains, array load/store decomposition, workgroup uniform load** —
  Matrix column+component UAV access, multi-member struct arrays, 512-element array copy,
  StmtWorkGroupUniformLoad as barrier+load+barrier pattern.

- **DXIL: 8 texture sampling intrinsics** — OpSample(60), OpSampleBias(61),
  OpSampleLevel(62), OpSampleGrad(63), OpSampleCmp(64), OpSampleCmpLevelZero(65),
  OpTextureGather(73), OpTextureGatherCmp(74). Previously only OpSample.

- **DXIL: binding array dynamic handles** — `dx.op.createHandle` with dynamic index
  for `binding_array<T>` resources. Both ExprAccess and ExprAccessIndex paths.

- **DXIL: NumWorkGroups via synthetic CBV** — `$Globals` CBV with cbufferLoadLegacy
  for compute dispatch dimensions (DXIL has no intrinsic, matches DXC approach).

- **DXIL: ray query intrinsics (SM 6.5)** — 35 new opcodes (178-212): allocateRayQuery,
  traceRayInline, proceed, candidateType, committedStatus, all intersection getters.
  RayIntersection struct (34 components). Auto SM upgrade to 6.5.

- **DXIL: image atomics** — StmtImageAtomic via dx.op.atomicBinOp/atomicCompareExchange
  with texture handles and spatial coordinates.

- **DXIL: wave/subgroup operations (SM 6.0+)** — 13 wave intrinsics: waveGetLaneIndex(111),
  waveGetLaneCount(112), waveAnyTrue(113), waveAllTrue(114), waveActiveBallot(116),
  waveReadLaneAt(117), waveReadLaneFirst(118), waveActiveOp(119), waveActiveBit(120),
  wavePrefixOp(121), quadReadLaneAt(122), quadOp(123).

- **DXIL: DXC dumpbin validation** — **163/163 testable shaders pass DXC dumpbin (100%)**.
  Zero val_fail. Zero compile_fail. 2 expected fail (no entry points).
  ALL 6 backends at 100%. World's first Pure Go DXIL generator at full validation.

### Fixed (other backends)

- **SPIR-V: OpIMul for vec4\<f32\>*f32 after unpack4x8unorm (BUG-SPIRV-003)** —
  `resolveMathType()` missing return types for 10 pack/unpack functions. `unpack4x8unorm(u32)`
  returned `u32` instead of `vec4<f32>`, causing `OpIMul` instead of `OpVectorTimesScalar`.
  Fixes gg#252, naga#61.

### Changed

- **SPIR-V Rust reference: allow-list for intentional divergences** — Unified allow-list
  across all backends (SPIR-V/MSL/HLSL/GLSL) for shaders where our output intentionally
  differs from Rust naga (Workgroup layout-free types per VUID-StandaloneSpirv-None-10684,
  no-compact-pass for entry-point-less shaders). 0 fail across all backends.

- **SPIR-V validation: 165/165** — Added `ptr-deref-test` shader (+1 from v0.17.2).

## [0.17.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **SPIR-V: OpFunctionCall type mismatch with Workgroup values (BUG-SPIRV-002)** — Regression
  from v0.17.1 Workgroup fix. Values loaded from `Workgroup` variables had layout-free types
  that propagated into `OpFunctionCall` arguments, causing type mismatch with decorated function
  parameters. Fix: insert `OpCopyLogical` immediately after every `OpLoad` from Workgroup
  (in `emitLoad`, `emitAccess`, `emitAccessIndex`), converting layout-free → decorated at the
  load point. Guard `maybeCopyLogicalForStore` against double-conversion when value is already
  decorated. Validated: 164/164 naga shaders + 23/23 gg GPU shaders pass spirv-val v2026.1.
  (gogpu/wgpu#134, reported by @SideFx via gogpu/ui#67)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **SPIR-V: Workgroup ArrayStride violation (VUID-StandaloneSpirv-None-10684)** — SPIR-V backend
  emitted `ArrayStride` decoration on array types used in `Workgroup` storage class, which is
  forbidden without `SPV_KHR_workgroup_memory_explicit_layout`. Intel Vulkan silently accepted this,
  but Qualcomm Adreno correctly rejected it — causing invisible text on Snapdragon X Elite.
  Fix: emit separate layout-free type declarations for Workgroup variables (arrays without
  `ArrayStride`, structs without `Offset`/`MatrixStride`). Uses `OpCopyLogical` (SPIR-V 1.4+)
  to bridge Workgroup ↔ Storage type mismatches. Constant deduplication added to prevent
  duplicate `OpConstant` IDs that break `OpCopyLogical` type equivalence.
  Rust naga has the same bug ([gfx-rs/wgpu#7696](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/7696),
  fix PR [#9295](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/9295) still open).
  (gogpu/wgpu#134, reported by @SideFx via gogpu/ui#67)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **DXIL backend (experimental)** — First Pure Go DXIL generator. Direct DXIL
  generation from naga IR for DX12 Shader Model 6.0. Eliminates FXC/DXC compiler
  dependency entirely. Zero CGO, zero external dependencies.
  **Verified: 2400+ frames at 60 FPS on D3D12 (Intel Iris Xe).**
  Rust naga has not implemented this (open issue since 2020).
  190 tests, ~12.5K LOC. Public API: `dxil.Compile()`, `dxil.DefaultOptions()`.
  - LLVM 3.7 bitcode writer with VBR encoding, nested blocks, abbreviation records
  - DXBC container with DXIL, ISG1, OSG1, PSV0, SFI0, HASH parts
  - BYPASS hash (Agility SDK 1.615+, January 2025) — no dxil.dll signing needed
  - Full expression lowering: literals, binary/unary ops, compose, access, splat,
    select, load/store, swizzle, derivatives, relational, type casts (10 LLVM
    cast opcodes), math intrinsics (30+ functions including min/max/clamp/dot/
    cross/mix/fma/smoothstep/pow/length/distance/normalize)
  - Control flow: LLVM basic blocks with br/br_cond, loops with back edges,
    break/continue via loop context stack, BreakIf support
  - Local variables: alloca + load + store with proper bitcode serialization
  - Resource bindings: dx.op.createHandle(57) for CBV/SRV/Sampler,
    dx.op.sample(60) for texture sampling, dx.resources metadata
  - I/O signatures: ISG1/OSG1 with semantic mapping (SV_Position, TEXCOORD,
    SV_Target, SV_VertexID, SV_InstanceID, SV_IsFrontFace, SV_Depth)
  - Pipeline state validation: PSV0 with runtime info, shader stage, wave lanes
  - Vector scalarization: DXIL has no native vectors — vec4 = 4 separate values,
    per-component tracking via exprComponents map
  - dx.op intrinsic system: overload-typed function declarations, lazy caching
  - Value ID remapping: emitter local IDs → serializer global numbering via finalize()
  - Error hardening: unsupported features return errors (not silent skip)

## [0.16.6] - 2026-04-05

### Performance

- **TypeRegistry zero-alloc lookups** — Refactored `normalizeType()` to `appendTypeKey()`
  using `keyBuf []byte` with inline `string(keyBuf)` map index (Go compiler optimization).
  Eliminates heap string allocation per type lookup. large_pbr: -59 allocs/op.
- **Lexer token preallocation** — Token slice estimate `len(source)/4` (was `/6`).
  Prevents slice regrowth for typical shaders.
- **SPIR-V Backend reuse** — `Backend.Reset()` + `ModuleBuilder.Reset()` clear
  all state without deallocating (Go 1.21+ `clear()` keeps map capacity).
  `Compile()` calls `Reset()` internally. Small shaders: 4.9× fewer allocs
  (68→14), 14× fewer bytes (17KB→1.2KB). Reuse benchmarks included.
- **Lowerer/Parser pre-sizing** — Expression, statement, declaration slices
  pre-allocated based on AST size estimates. TypeRegistry capacity hints.
- **Overall: 594 → 562 allocs/op (-5.4%). SPIR-V reuse: 68 → 14 allocs (4.9×).**

## [0.16.5] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **Dead code removal** — Removed 3 unused functions found by full codebase audit
  (398 symbols scanned across 6 packages): `flattenBinding` (glsl), 
  `concretizeTypeInner` (ir/compact), `resolveLiteralTypeInner` (ir/process_overrides).

## [0.16.4] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **GLSL: per-element loop for workgroup array zero-init** — Same fix as HLSL:
  arrays >= 256 elements use `for` loop instead of inline constructor list
  (`Type[256](elem, elem, ... ×256)` = 12KB single line). Prevents GL driver
  compiler slowdown and potential crashes on mobile/embedded GL drivers.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Per-element loop for workgroup array zero-init** — FXC hangs 22 seconds on
  `(StructType[256])0` bulk assign. Replaced with per-element `for` loop:
  `for (uint _naga_zi_0 = 0u; ...) { arr[_naga_zi_0] = (ElementType)0; }`.
  Compilation time: 22s → 68ms. Handles nested arrays recursively.
  First implementation in the industry to fix this — Rust naga, ANGLE, Dawn
  all have the same bug or workaround it differently.
  See `docs/dev/research/HLSL-ZERO-INIT-FXC-HANG-RESEARCH.md`.
- **Defaults changed to match Rust** — `ForceLoopBounding: true`,
  `RestrictIndexing: true` (were both `false`).

#### HLSL backend: parity fixes

- **Dot4I8Packed/Dot4U8Packed** — dot4add intrinsics (SM 6.4+) with polyfill. (3 shaders)
- **Pack4xI8/U8/Clamp + Unpack4xI8/U8** — shift+mask polyfills. (2 shaders)

- **Float exponent formatting** — removed spurious '+' in exponents. (1 shader)
- **naga_extractBits/naga_insertBits** — per-type overloads matching Rust. (1 shader)
- **Pack/Unpack 2x16/4x8 snorm/unorm/float** — all 10 inline polyfills. (1 shader)
- **f16 infrastructure** — NagaConstants struct, matrix padding, storage Store patterns. (1 shader)
- **Demand-driven StorageLoadHelpers** — match Rust approach. (1 shader)

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V binary validation: 29 → 0 failures, 16 → 0 compile failures (164/164 pass)

All fixes validated against Rust naga reference (`naga/src/back/spv/`).
SPIR-V TestRustReference: 4/87 → 90/93 (3 minor structural gaps, not bugs).

- **Depth texture sampling** — Dref sampling uses scalar f32 result type;
  non-Dref depth sampling uses vec4 then CompositeExtract for first component.
  Matches Rust naga image.rs:823-837. (4 shaders)

- **Function pointer arguments** — `isPointerExpression` now recognizes
  pointer-typed FunctionArgument params. `emitCall` uses `emitPointerExpression`
  for pointer parameters. (1 shader: access)

- **Integer dot product** — OpDot only works on float vectors. Integer dot
  products now use manual expansion (CompositeExtract + IMul + IAdd).
  Matches Rust naga write_dot_product. (1 shader)

- **FMix scalar-to-vector splatting** — When FMix selector is scalar but
  operands are vectors, splat scalar via OpCompositeConstruct.
  Matches Rust naga Mix handling. (2 shaders)

- **Integer vec×scalar multiply** — OpIMul requires matching types. Scalar
  operand splatted to vector via OpCompositeConstruct before IMul.
  Matches Rust naga write_vector_scalar_mult. (1 shader)

- **Matrix add/sub decomposition** — SPIR-V FAdd/FSub don't work on matrix
  types. Decomposed into column-wise vector operations.
  Matches Rust naga write_matrix_matrix_column_op. (1 shader)

- **VectorTimesMatrix result type** — Result vector size must equal matrix
  column count, not left vector size. Also fixed MatrixTimesMatrix for
  non-square matrices. (1 shader)

- **ImageQuerySize dimensionality** — Result type now matches image
  dimensionality (2D→vec2, 3D→vec3, etc.) instead of always vec3.
  ImageQueryNumLayers uses OpImageQuerySizeLod + CompositeExtract.
  Matches Rust naga image.rs:1142-1210. (1 shader)

- **Bitcast width conversion** — Width-changing integer casts now use
  OpUConvert/OpSConvert instead of OpBitcast (which requires equal bit width).
  Matches Rust naga block.rs:2061-2066. (1 shader + 5 bonus)

- **Atomic int64 result types** — Atomic operations on int64 now use correct
  64-bit scalar result type instead of hardcoded 32-bit. (2 shaders)

- **AtomicCompareExchange struct** — OpAtomicCompareExchange returns scalar,
  not struct. Now constructs `{old_value, exchanged}` struct via
  OpCompositeConstruct with OpIEqual for the exchanged bool.
  Matches Rust naga block.rs:3414+. (2 shaders + 1 bonus)

- **ControlBarrier SubgroupMemory** — Fixed MemorySemanticsSubgroupMemory
  constant (0x80, not 0x200). Barrier emission now matches Rust naga
  write_control_barrier. (1 shader)

- **ConstOffset image operand** — Changed from ConstOffsets (0x40, Gather-only)
  to ConstOffset (0x08, valid for all sampling). (partial fix)

- **Image store coordinates** — Integer coordinates now use proper bitcast
  instead of float conversion. (2 shaders)

- **External texture handling** — ImageClassExternal uses float sampled type
  and OpImageQuerySizeLod for queries. (1 shader)

- **ImageGatherExtended capability** — Removed spurious emission for
  ConstOffset operands. Only needed for dynamic Offset. (1 shader)

- **spirv-val target env** — Uses spv1.6 for general SPIR-V correctness
  validation, with --uniform-buffer-standard-layout for std430 matrix stride.

- **Pointer function arguments** — Copy-in/copy-out (spill) pattern for passing
  OpAccessChain results to OpFunctionCall. SPIR-V requires memory object declarations
  (OpVariable/OpFunctionParameter) as pointer arguments. (3 shaders)

- **Image Lod float conversion** — SPIR-V ExplicitLod requires float Lod operand.
  Integer level converted via OpConvertSToF/OpConvertUToF. (2 shaders)

- **Binding arrays RuntimeArray** — Proper wrapping in Block-decorated struct. (1 shader)

- **Mesh shaders** — MeshEXT/TaskEXT execution models, SPV_EXT_mesh_shader
  extension, OutputVertices/OutputPrimitivesEXT execution modes. (4 shaders)

- **Pipeline overrides (OpSpecConstant)** — ExprOverride expressions emitted as
  OpSpecConstant/OpSpecConstantComposite with SpecId decoration. (3 shaders)

- **Image atomics (OpImageTexelPointer)** — StmtImageAtomic emits
  OpImageTexelPointer then standard atomic ops on the texel pointer. (2 shaders)

- **WorkGroupUniformLoad** — Emitted as ControlBarrier + OpLoad + ControlBarrier
  matching Rust naga's pattern. (1 shader)

- **Pack4xI8/U8/Clamp + Unpack4xI8/U8** — Shift+mask pack/unpack polyfills
  for 4×8-bit integer packing. (5 shaders)

- **ProcessOverrides remap fixes** — StmtAtomic.Compare and StmtRayQuery
  fields now correctly remapped during override processing. (2 shaders)

### Known Issues

- **0 SPIR-V binary validation failures.** All 164 shaders compile and pass spirv-val.

- **3 SPIR-V structural differences** from Rust reference (Int8 capability,
  decoration counts) — not validation or compilation issues.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **GLSL: TextureMappings in TranslationInfo** — Reports texture-sampler
  binding pairs for combined sampler2D, enabling GLES HAL SamplerBindMap
  construction. Matches Rust naga ReflectionInfo pattern.

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V binary validation: 63 → 29 failures (−34 fixed)

All fixes validated against Rust naga reference (`naga/src/back/spv/`).

- **SPV_KHR_storage_buffer_storage_class extension** — StorageBuffer storage
  class requires this extension for SPIR-V < 1.3 (default version is 1.1).
  Matches Rust naga writer.rs:2580. (5 shaders)

- **Workgroup ArrayStride decoration** — Workgroup variables must not have
  explicit layout decorations per VUID-StandaloneSpirv-None-10684. Added
  layout-free type emission for Workgroup address space. (1 shader)

- **OpLoad on runtime-sized arrays** — SPIR-V forbids loading entire
  runtime-sized arrays. Global variables containing runtime arrays now return
  pointers instead of loaded values. (2 shaders)

- **OpImageFetch result type** — Hardcoded vec4<f32> replaced with correct
  type derived from image SampledKind. (1 shader)

- **SPV_KHR_multiview, SPV_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric,
  SPV_KHR_integer_dot_product extensions** — Added when corresponding
  capabilities are used. (6 shaders)

- **CapabilityImageGatherExtended** — Added for textureGather with offset. (2 shaders)

- **SampleMask BuiltIn** — Wrapped in array<u32,1> per SPIR-V spec. (1 shader)

- **SPIR-V version 1.3 requirement** — RequireVersion(1.3) for subgroup/
  GroupNonUniform capabilities. (1 shader)

- **Duplicate OpTypeSampler** — Cached to emit exactly once. (3 shaders)

- **ClipDistance/PrimitiveIndex builtins** — Added to builtinToSPIRV mapping. (1 shader)

- **OpAtomicFAddEXT (6035)** — Float32 atomics use OpAtomicFAddEXT instead
  of OpAtomicIAdd. Atomic scalar resolution returns kind+width for int64. (4 shaders)

- **AtomicCompareExchange unequal semantics** — Unequal operand uses Acquire
  (not AcquireRelease) per VUID-StandaloneSpirv-UnequalMemorySemantics-10875. (3 shaders)

- **ExecutionModeDepthReplacing** — Fragment shaders writing FragDepth now
  emit DepthReplacing per VUID-FragDepth-FragDepth-04216. (2 shaders)

- **SPV_KHR_integer_dot_product version comparison** — Fixed 0x10006 → 0x10600
  (SPIR-V version encoding is major<<16|minor<<8). (2 shaders)

#### GLSL

- **Depth texture combined sampler naming** — When a depth texture is used with
  both regular and comparison samplers, the combined sampler names were swapped
  due to non-deterministic Go map iteration. Fixed with deterministic sorting. (1 shader)

### Known Issues

- **29 SPIR-V binary validation failures** at release time. Fixed in [Unreleased]
  section above (29 → 6 remaining).

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **HLSL: revert direct sampler kostyl, restore heap pattern** — Reverted the
  direct sampler register binding from v0.15.1. DX12 HAL now implements proper
  sampler heap.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **HLSL: revert direct sampler register binding mode** — Samplers always use the
  sampler heap indirection pattern (`nagaSamplerHeap[indexBuffer[N]]`), matching
  Rust wgpu-hal architecture. The DX12 HAL now properly implements the global
  sampler heap with per-bind-group sampler index buffers and provides
  `SamplerBufferBindingMap` to naga during shader compilation.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Subgroup operations** — `subgroupBallot`, `subgroupAdd/Mul/Min/Max/And/Or/Xor`,
  `subgroupBroadcast/First`, `subgroupShuffle*`, `quadSwap*`, `subgroupBarrier`.
  Full SPIR-V backend with correct capabilities. HLSL/MSL/GLSL placeholders.
- **Vector const-exprs** — component-wise binary operations at module scope
  (`const X = vec2(1.0) + vec2(3.0, 4.0)`). Splat expansion for scalar→vector.
- **Override declarations** — `@id(N) override name: type = default;`
- **f16/i64/u64/f64 scalar types** — `enable f16/int64;` directives, literal
  suffixes (`1.0h`, `42li`, `42lu`, `1.0lf`), type constructors

- **164 WGSL test shaders** — 144/144 Rust reference (100%) + 20 custom

### Changed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Block Ownership Model (NAGA-ARCH-001)** — refactored function emission
  from flat instruction list to block-based architecture matching Rust naga.
  Each SPIR-V basic block is now a first-class `Block` struct consumed by
  `FunctionBuilder`. `LoopContext` passed by value for isolated nested loop
  contexts. Eliminates `loopStack`/`breakStack` mutable state and
  `blockEndsWithTerminator()` post-hoc checks. Produces identical SPIR-V
  output — zero behavioral changes.

### Performance

#### GLSL Backend
- **Dead code elimination via entry-point reachability (GLSL-001)** — GLSL
  writer now walks the call graph from the target entry point and only emits
  reachable types, constants, globals, and functions. SDF fragment shader
  output reduced from 639KB to target <50KB. Fixes 5-10 second startup
  delay on GLES backend ([naga#42](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/issues/42)).

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Workgroup Offset decoration removed (SPIRV-001)** — `emitTypeNoLayout()`
  now handles struct types by creating separate type IDs without Offset,
  ColMajor, or MatrixStride member decorations. Fixes Vulkan validation error
  `VUID-StandaloneSpirv-None-10684` on all Vello compute shaders. Matches
  Rust naga `global_needs_wrapper()` pattern.

#### MSL Backend
- **Workgroup variables emitted as entry point parameters (MSL-002)** —
  `var<workgroup>` globals now appear as `threadgroup T& name` parameters
  in compute entry points. Previously skipped because they have no resource
  binding. Fixes `undeclared identifier 'sh_scratch'` on macOS Metal.
- **Barrier calls fully namespace-qualified** — `threadgroup_barrier()` and
  `mem_flags` now prefixed with `metal::`. Fixes `undeclared identifier
  'mem_flags'` on strict Metal compilers.
- **Runtime-sized array typedef** — dynamic arrays (`array<T>`) now emit
  `typedef T name[1];` in MSL output. Fixes `unknown type name 'type_6'`
  for storage buffer parameters.

## [0.14.8] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

#### GLSL Backend
- **Bind group collision in GLSL output** — `@group(0) @binding(0)` and
  `@group(1) @binding(0)` both generated `layout(binding = 0)`, causing
  uniform shadowing on GLES. SDF viewport uniform was overwritten by clip
  uniform, making all SDF shapes invisible. Now flattens to unique GL
  binding points: `group * 16 + binding + base`.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

#### MSL Backend
- **Multi-group binding index collision** — `@group(0) @binding(0)` and `@group(1) @binding(0)` both mapped to Metal `[[buffer(0)]]`, causing shader compilation failure on macOS. The MSL backend now assigns sequential per-type indices (buffer, texture, sampler) across all bind groups sorted by `(group, binding)`, matching the Rust wgpu-hal approach. When `PerEntryPointMap` provides explicit mappings, those take priority. ([gogpu/gg#209](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/209))

## [0.14.6] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

#### MSL Backend
- **Pass-through globals for helper functions** — textures, samplers, uniforms, and storage buffers used by non-entry-point functions are now passed as extra parameters and arguments; previously MSL helper functions could not access entry point resource bindings, causing `undeclared identifier` errors (e.g., `msdf_atlas`, `msdf_sampler`, `sh_scratch`) for any shader with helper functions referencing global resources ([gogpu/ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.14.5] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

#### MSL Backend
- **Buffer parameters use references (`&`) instead of pointers (`*`)** — buffer parameters now generate `constant Uniforms& u [[buffer(0)]]` (reference) instead of `constant Uniforms* u [[buffer(0)]]` (pointer); pointer syntax required `->` or `(*u).` for member access while the expression writer generates `.` access, causing Metal compilation errors on Apple Silicon ([gogpu/ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.14.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

#### MSL Backend
- **Vertex `[[stage_in]]` for struct-typed arguments** — vertex shaders with struct-typed inputs (e.g., `fn vs_main(in: VertexInput)`) now correctly generate a synthesized `_Input` struct with `[[attribute(N)]]` members and `[[stage_in]]` parameter; previously only fragment stage was handled, causing undefined `in_` reference ([gogpu/ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))
- **`metal::discard_fragment()` namespace** — `discard_fragment()` now emits with required `metal::` namespace prefix; bare call was rejected by Metal shader compiler

## [0.14.3] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Deferred store for multiple call results** — Variables initialized from expressions containing multiple function call results now correctly emit deferred `OpStore` instructions for each intermediate result
- **Deferred store for `var x = atomicOp()`** — Atomic operation results used in variable initialization now correctly generate deferred stores instead of losing the value (NAGA-SPV-006)
- **`OpLogicalEqual` for bool comparisons** — Boolean equality expressions now emit correct `OpLogicalEqual` opcode; transitive deferred stores propagate through boolean comparison chains
- **Atomic result type for `atomic<i32>` struct fields** — Atomic operations on signed integer struct members now use correct `OpTypeInt 32 1` result type instead of unsigned
- **Prologue var init splitting** — Variable initializations that reference other local variables are now split from the function prologue into `StmtStore` at the declaration point, preventing use-before-definition in SPIR-V (NAGA-SPV-007)

## [0.14.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

#### Test Infrastructure
- **Golden snapshot test system** (`snapshot/`) — compiles 30 WGSL shaders through all 4 backends (SPIR-V, GLSL, HLSL, MSL), compares output to ~118 stored golden files; supports `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` for regeneration
- **20 new reference shaders** — collatz, atomics, workgroup_memory, quad, vertex_colors, uniforms_mvp, multi_output, math_builtins, conversions, swizzle, expressions_complex, structs, arrays, matrices, let_and_var, loops_advanced, switch_advanced, texture_sample, texture_storage, pointers
- **WGSL error case tests** (`wgsl/wgsl_errors_test.go`) — 76 test cases covering parse errors (39) and lowering errors (37): unknown types, unresolved identifiers, missing tokens, wrong builtin argument counts, reserved words
- **IR validator semantic tests** (`ir/validate_semantic_test.go`) — 47 test functions covering type validation, constants/globals, entry points, functions, expressions, statements, and positive edge cases
- **SPIR-V capability tracking tests** (`spirv/capabilities_test.go`) — 13 test functions verifying correct OpCapability emission: Shader always present, Float16/64, Int8/16/64, ImageQuery, DotProduct, no-emit-when-unused, no duplicates
- **SPIR-V disassembler** for golden snapshots — extracted from `cmd/spvdis/` into reusable test helper, produces diff-friendly text output

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Deterministic output** — replaced `map[int]uint32` with `[]uint32` slices for entry point interface variables and struct member extraction; Go map iteration order was causing non-reproducible SPIR-V binaries

#### GLSL Backend
- Emit `#extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable` for desktop GLSL < 4.10 — `layout(location)` on inter-stage varyings requires this extension; NVIDIA drivers reject generated code without it ([#31](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/issues/31))

## [0.14.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

#### HLSL Backend
- `row_major` qualifier for matrix struct members in cbuffer/uniform blocks — DX12 `M[i]` column access was returning rows instead of columns, causing transposed transforms and invisible geometry
- `mul(right, left)` argument reversal for `row_major` matrices — HLSL `mul()` semantics differ from WGSL `*` operator when layout changes
- Unique entry point names — prevent HLSL duplicate function errors when multiple entry points reference the same function
- Typed call results — function calls now use correct return type instead of void

#### GLSL Backend
- Clear `namedExpressions` between function compilations — expression handle names from one WGSL function were leaking into subsequent functions, causing `undeclared identifier` errors in GLES shaders

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-21

Major WGSL language coverage expansion: 15/15 Essential reference shaders from Rust naga test suite now compile to valid SPIR-V.

### Added

#### SPIR-V Backend
- `OpTranspose` (native SPIR-V opcode 84) with matrix type swap
- Matrix type caching (prevents duplicate OpTypeMatrix)
- 25 new math functions: bit manipulation (countOneBits, reverseBits, extractBits, insertBits, firstLeadingBit, firstTrailingBit, countLeadingZeros, countTrailingZeros), pack/unpack (4x8snorm, 4x8unorm, 2x16snorm, 2x16unorm, 2x16float), quantizeToF16
- `OpSDotKHR` / `OpUDotKHR` with SPV_KHR_integer_dot_product extension
- `OpImageGather` / `OpImageDrefGather` with component index
- `OpBitCount`, `OpBitReverse`, `OpBitFieldInsert`, `OpBitFieldSExtract`, `OpBitFieldUExtract`
- Pointer access chains on function arguments
- `findCallResultInTree` extended to 12+ expression types
- `BindingArrayType` emission (OpTypeArray/OpTypeRuntimeArray)
- Identity conversion early return

#### IR
- `BindingArrayType` struct for descriptor array types

#### Testing
- **17 reference shader regression tests** — 15 Essential + 2 bonus (skybox, water) from Rust naga test suite, embedded as string literals for CI compatibility
- SPIR-V validation via `spirv-val` in CI

### Fixed

#### WGSL Frontend
- Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`) on local variables — removed explicit ExprLoad
- `textureDimensions` accepting 1 argument (texture only)
- `>>` token splitting for nested template closing (`ptr<function, vec3<f32>>`)
- Const with constructor expressions (`const light = vec3<f32>(1,2,3)`)
- Unary negation in constant expressions (`const X = -0.1`)
- `let` bindings emitted at declaration point for SSA dominance correctness
- Float literals without trailing digit (`1.` now parsed correctly)
- Module-level constants with constructor initializers
- Switch statement termination analysis for exhaustive matching
- Trailing semicolons after closing braces no longer cause parse errors
- Vector type inference from constructor arguments

#### SPIR-V Backend
- `OpIMul` result type for scalar*vector promotion (was using scalar type instead of vector)

- `let` variable semantics — emit `OpLoad` for `let` bindings (value semantics, not reference)
- `OpCapability ImageQuery` emitted when using `textureDimensions`/`textureNumLevels`

- `atomicStore` / `atomicLoad` — correct SPIR-V opcode emission
- Workgroup variable layout decorations (Offset, ArrayStride)
- `OpDecorate Block` deduplication — no longer emits duplicate decorations
- Loop `continuing` block codegen — correct back-edge and merge block structure
- Uniform struct wrapping — storage/uniform buffer structs get correct member decorations
- Vector type conversion in composite constructors

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-17

SPIR-V OpArrayLength fix, comprehensive benchmarks, and compiler allocation optimization (−32%).

### Fixed

- **SPIR-V `OpArrayLength`** — Runtime-sized array length queries (`arrayLength()`) now emit
  correct `OpArrayLength` instruction. Handles both bare storage arrays (wrapped in synthetic
  struct) and struct member arrays. Fixes "unsupported expression kind: ExprArrayLength" crash
  in compute shaders with dynamic buffer sizes.

### Added

- **Comprehensive compiler benchmarks** — 68 benchmarks across all 7 packages (root, wgsl, spirv,
  glsl, hlsl, msl, ir) with `ReportAllocs()` and `b.SetBytes()` throughput metrics. Covers
  full pipeline (lex→parse→lower→validate→generate), cross-backend comparison, and per-stage
  isolation. Table-driven by shader complexity (small/medium/large).

### Changed

- **Compiler allocation reduction (−32.3%)** — Large PBR shader: 1384→937 allocs, 203KB→134KB.
  Word arena for SPIR-V instructions (eliminates per-instruction `make()`), shared
  `InstructionBuilder` with `Reset()`, package-level lookup tables in lowerer (eliminates
  6 map allocations per compile including 66-entry `getMathFunction`), capacity hints in
  parser/lexer/backend. SPIR-V generate stage: −58.4% allocs. Lowerer bytes: −68.6%.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-15

GLSL backend improvements, HLSL struct entry point fix, and SPIR-V vector/scalar multiply and bool conversion fixes.

### Added

#### GLSL Backend
- **UBO blocks for struct uniforms** — Struct uniform variables now emit `layout(std140) uniform BlockName { ... }` blocks instead of bare uniform declarations

#### Testing
- **SPIR-V loop iteration regression tests** — Tests verifying correct loop codegen

### Fixed

#### GLSL Backend

### Changed
- Removed unused test helper `validateSPIRVBinaryBasic`

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-13

Hotfix: wire up HLSL codegen (was causing DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION BSOD on DX12), complete all 93 WGSL built-in functions.

### Added

#### WGSL Frontend
- **All 93 WGSL built-in functions** — Complete coverage of the W3C WGSL specification
  - 14 math functions: `modf`, `frexp`, `ldexp`, `inverse`, `quantizeToF16`, `outerProduct`, `pack4xI8`/`U8`, `pack4xI8Clamp`/`U8Clamp`, `unpack4xI8`/`U8`
  - 9 derivative functions: `dpdx`, `dpdy`, `fwidth` + `Coarse`/`Fine` variants
  - 4 relational functions: `all`, `any`, `isnan`, `isinf`
  - `arrayLength` for runtime-sized arrays

#### Testing
- **HLSL end-to-end golden tests** — 14 tests covering the full WGSL → HLSL pipeline
  - Triangle shader, vertex/fragment, compute, uniform buffers
  - Math functions, control flow (if/else, switch, loops), swizzle
  - Entry point deduplication, stub detection, semantic validation

### Fixed

#### HLSL Backend
- **Wire up codegen** — Connect implemented expression/statement/function codegen to the writer
  - Entry point functions now generate actual HLSL bodies instead of stub placeholders
  - Regular functions call `writeFunctionBody()` for complete code generation
  - Entry points use `writeEntryPointWithIO()` with proper I/O structs and semantics
  - Removed duplicate function emission (entry points were written twice)

- **Builtin extraction** — `@builtin(vertex_index)` correctly extracted from input struct to local variable
- **Array syntax** — HLSL arrays now use correct syntax:
  - Declarations: `float2 name[3]` instead of `float2[3] name`
  - Initializers: `{elem1, elem2}` instead of `type[3](elem1, elem2)`
- **Named expression ordering** — Expression names cached AFTER writing initializer (prevents `float x = x;`)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-10

SPIR-V function call support and compute shader codegen improvements for GPU SDF pipeline.

### Added

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **`OpFunctionCall`** — Function call support for non-entry-point functions

  - `sdf_analysis_test.go` — Validates SPIR-V output for SDF batch shader patterns
  - `var_ifelse_test.go` — Tests variable initialization and if/else codegen

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Compute shader codegen** — Multiple fixes for real-world compute shader patterns
  - Fixed `var` initialization from expressions (was emitting zero instead of computed value)
  - Fixed hex literal suffix parsing (`0xFFu` now correctly parsed as `u32`)
  - Improved expression handling for complex compute shader workflows

#### WGSL Frontend
- **Hex literal suffixes** — `0xFFu` and `0xFFi` now correctly parsed with type suffix

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-09

Critical SPIR-V opcode corrections and compute shader fixes. Fixes incorrect code generation for logical operators, comparisons, shifts, and local variable initializers — all discovered during GPU SDF compute shader development.

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **`OpLogicalAnd` opcode** — Was 164 (`OpLogicalEqual`), corrected to 167 per SPIR-V spec
  - WGSL `&&` compiled to boolean equality instead of logical AND
  - `false && false` incorrectly evaluated to `true`
  - Caused filled rectangles to render as outlines in compute shaders
- **Comparison opcodes swapped** — `OpFOrdGreaterThan` and `OpFOrdLessThanEqual` had each other's values
  - `>` behaved as `<=` and vice versa in float comparisons
- **Shift opcodes rotated** — `OpShiftLeftLogical`, `OpShiftRightLogical`, `OpShiftRightArithmetic` corrected
  - Bit shift operations produced wrong results (e.g., RGBA channel packing)
- **Local variable initializers** — `var x: f32 = 0.0` now emits `OpStore` for the initial value
  - `OpVariable` was emitted without initializer; `LocalVariable.Init` field was ignored by backend
  - Variables started with undefined values, causing conditional stores to not propagate
- **Entry point interface** — Only Input/Output variables listed per SPIR-V 1.3 spec
  - Uniform and StorageBuffer variables no longer incorrectly included
- **Void function termination** — Explicit `OpReturn` for functions without terminator
- **Boolean literal type** — Consistent type deduplication via `emitScalarType`
- **Runtime-sized arrays** — `OpTypeRuntimeArray` for storage buffer `array<T>` (was returning error)
- **Type conversions** — `f32(x)`, `u32(y)` now generate correct conversion opcodes instead of compose
- **Unsigned integer literals** — `1u` suffix correctly parsed as `u32` (was always `i32`)
- **Array stride** — Automatic `ArrayStride` decoration for runtime arrays (std430 layout)

#### WGSL Frontend
- **`f16` pre-registration removed** — No longer emits `OpCapability Float16` in shaders that don't use `f16`
  - Fixes Vulkan validation errors on devices without `shaderFloat16` support

### Added
- `OpLogicalEqual` (164), `OpLogicalNotEqual` (165) SPIR-V opcodes
- `OpConvertFToU`, `OpConvertFToS`, `OpConvertSToF`, `OpConvertUToF`, `OpBitcast` conversion opcodes
- `nagac` now targets SPIR-V 1.3 by default

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-07

SPIR-V control flow fix and 55 new WGSL built-in math functions.

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **`if/else` control flow** — Fixed invalid SPIR-V causing GPU hang on all drivers
  - Root cause: `blockEndsWithTerminator()` didn't handle `StmtBlock` wrapper from WGSL lowerer
  - Reject branch wrapped in `StmtBlock{}` by `lowerStatement()` vs flat `lowerBlock()` for accept
  - Result: `OpReturn` emitted in reject block followed by spurious `OpBranch` (two terminators)
  - Merge block left without terminator — undefined behavior in structured control flow
  - Fix: Added `StmtBlock` and nested `StmtIf` handling to `blockEndsWithTerminator()`
  - Added `OpUnreachable` emission for merge blocks when both branches terminate
  - Fixed `AddLabel()` → `AddLabelWithID()` for correct merge block targeting

### Added

#### WGSL Built-in Functions (55 new, 67 total math functions)
- **Trigonometric**: `cosh`, `sinh`, `tanh`, `acos`, `asin`, `atan`, `atan2`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`

- **Computational**: `sign`, `fma`, `mix`, `step`, `smoothstep`, `inverseSqrt`, `saturate`
- **Matrix**: `transpose`, `determinant`

- **Data packing**: `pack4x8snorm`, `pack4x8unorm`, `pack2x16snorm`, `pack2x16unorm`, `pack2x16float`
- **Data unpacking**: `unpack4x8snorm`, `unpack4x8unorm`, `unpack2x16snorm`, `unpack2x16unorm`, `unpack2x16float`
- **Selection**: `select(falseVal, trueVal, condition)` — Component-wise selection

#### Testing
- SPIR-V `if/else` control flow test — validates correct block termination
- 55 new math function compilation tests — all functions verified end-to-end
- `select()` function test with scalar and vector variants

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-01

- Removed unused code from SPIR-V backend

## [0.8.4] - 2026-01-10

Critical SPIR-V backend fix for Intel Vulkan driver compatibility.

### Fixed

#### SPIR-V Backend
- **Instruction ordering** — Fixed OpVariable declarations to appear before OpLoad instructions
  - SPIR-V spec requires all OpVariable at START of first block
  - Intel Iris Xe Graphics was rejecting shaders with incorrect ordering
  - Other drivers (NVIDIA, AMD) were more lenient but technically incorrect
- **Array access semantics** — Added OpLoad after OpAccessChain
  - OpAccessChain returns pointer, but consumers expect values
  - Fixed undefined behavior in array/struct member access

### Changed
- **Constant naming** — Renamed BuiltIn*Id constants to BuiltIn*ID (Go naming convention)
  - `BuiltInVertexId` → `BuiltInVertexID`
  - `BuiltInInstanceId` → `BuiltInInstanceID`
  - `BuiltInPrimitiveId` → `BuiltInPrimitiveID`
  - `BuiltInInvocationId` → `BuiltInInvocationID`

  - `BuiltInGlobalInvocationId` → `BuiltInGlobalInvocationID`

## [0.8.3] - 2026-01-04

Critical MSL backend fix for vertex shader position output.

### Fixed

#### MSL Backend
- **[[position]] attribute placement** — Fixed to emit on struct member instead of function signature
  - MSL requires `[[position]]` on struct member, not on function return type
  - Before: `vertex float4 vs_main(...) [[position]] { }` (invalid MSL)
  - After: `struct vs_main_Output { float4 member [[position]]; }; vertex vs_main_Output vs_main(...) { }` (valid MSL)
  - Matches behavior of original Rust naga implementation
- **Simple type output structs** — Now generates output struct for simple types with builtin bindings
- **Return statement handling** — Fixed return for simple type output structs

  - Caused "unknown function: clamp" error during shader compilation
  - Affected any WGSL shader using `clamp(value, min, max)`

### Added
- **Comprehensive math function tests** — `TestMathFunctions` covering all 12 WGSL built-in math functions

- **atomicMin/Max signed vs unsigned** — Now correctly uses `OpAtomicSMin`/`OpAtomicSMax` for signed integers and `OpAtomicUMin`/`OpAtomicUMax` for unsigned

#### WGSL Frontend
- **Function resolution** — Added pre-registration pass for forward function references
- **Return type attributes** — Parser now correctly handles attributes on return types (e.g., `@builtin(position)`)

### Changed
